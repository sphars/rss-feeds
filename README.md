# RSS Feeds

[![Fetch Feeds](https://github.com/sphars/rss-feeds/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sphars/rss-feeds/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Generating RSS feeds for sites that don't provide them. Mostly an exercise in scraping.

See also [OpenRSS](https://openrss.org/) for getting feeds for sites that don't provide their own.


## Sites

RSS feeds are currently generated for the following sites:

| Site | Homepage |
|------|----------|
| The Far Side | https://www.thefarside.com/ |

Other sites coming soon as I feel like it.

### Feeds
The feeds are generated by scraping the website and generating an XML file. A simple website is deployed with github pages that serves the feed file. The website is currently at **[sphars.github.io/rss-feeds](https://sphars.github.io/rss-feeds/)**

## Requirements
- python
- chromium
